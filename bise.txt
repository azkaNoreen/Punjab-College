A.O.A...Hope you are doing well. Sir, can you please guide me about National Talent Scholarship 2019.I am First position holder of ICS 2019. Sir, I received the form (Press realize of National Talent Scholarship) and it has been posted(in start of July ) to Secretary BOARD Office after filling up and Attestation from principal of institute I am currently studying in. Now, its September and I have got no reply from BOARD Office. I am worried as I only took admission because I thought that the scholarships and awards I'll receive  on the behalf of acquisition of position will be enough for my onward studies because My father is a labor and he is not capable of affording my study expenses .Kindly, tell me about the onward criteria of receiving this scholarship. 
Your cooperation in this regard will be highly appreciated. Thanks for you time.
